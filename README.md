# Blog-website
  created a fully functional blog website. This involved the integration of HTML, CSS, Node.js, and MongoDB to provide an immersive platform for reading and writing posts. To enhance security, I implemented token-based authentication, ensuring that only authorized users have access to specific functionalities. Additionally, I employed hashing techniques for password storage, prioritizing the safety and confidentiality of user data.
The incorporation of MongoDB as the database added a layer of efficiency, enabling seamless data management and retrieval.


Key Technologies Used:
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Node.js
4. MongoDB
   


packages used :
  1.  express
  2.  hbs
  3.  mongoose
  4.  nodemon  (npm install -g nodemon) to install globally
  5.  ejs
  6.  jsonwebtoken
  7.  cookie-parser

  # NOTE:
  extract the node_modules file and then run the server from the terminal ( npm run dev )
